**Day 1 \- Java Masters Course (1 hour)**

Today, I began the Java Masters course and focused on optimizing my learning experience. I learned how to adjust video quality for the best viewing experience and enable subtitles, which is especially helpful since Iâ€™m not a native English speaker. I also familiarized myself with the resources available for when I encounter difficulties, such as the comments section and the help section, which can provide assistance when needed.

I watched two YouTube videos discussing the journey of learning programming. These emphasized the importance of persistence and continuous exploration as essential components of success in programming.

I discovered that the Long-Term Support (LTS) versions of Java are currently Java 17 and Java 21, and this course will be based on Java 17\.

I then proceeded to install Java 17 and familiarize myself with the command shell by confirming the version using the `java -version` command. Additionally, I was introduced to `jshell`, a tool built into the command shell for writing simple Java statements interactively.

I wrote my first line of code in Java:

java  
Kopiuj  
`System.out.print("Hello World!");`

I also learned how to declare a variable in Java, for example:

java  
Kopiuj  
`int myFirstNumber = 5;`

The keyword `int` stands for **Integer**, which is a primitive data type in Java. These are predefined keywords in Java reserved for specific purposes, such as defining data types (e.g., `int`, `double`, `boolean`).

Next, I explored how to update the value of a variable and use it in more complex mathematical operations. For example:

java  
Kopiuj  
`myFirstNumber = (5 + 10) + (5 * 2);`

This allowed me to see how Java handles arithmetic operations and variable reassignment.
