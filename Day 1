I installed JDK (Java Development Kit) and IDE (Integrate Developer Enviroment) Eclipse. 
I started my first Java Project and wrote some simple print statements:

package main;

public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.print("\tI love piza!\n");
		System.out.print("It's really good!");
		System.out.println();
		
//This is comment

	}

}
I learned how to create an empty line by println or \n. I also found out how to create comments in Java.
